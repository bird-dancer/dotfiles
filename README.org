#+TITLE: README
#+DESCRIPTION: readme for my .dotfiles

* ~$HOME/.dotfiles~
my configs aim to rely on as much as possible built in features to be as light-weight, future-proof and easy to understand as possible

I use =gnu stow= to create symlinks from the =.dotfiles= repository/ folder to the locations where the config files are expected by their programs.

More complex/ longer configs are available as ={Prograname}.org= files for better readability and are tangled to the acutal config file.
