#+TITLE: README
#+DESCRIPTION: readme for my .dotfiles

* ~$HOME/.dotfiles~
my configs aim to rely on as much as possible built in features to be as light-weight, future-proof and easy to understand as possible

I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to create symlinks from the =.dotfiles= folder to the locations where the config files are expected by their programs by just running this command:
#+begin_src bash
  stow .
#+end_src

More complex/ longer configs are available as ={Program-name}.org= files for better readability and are tangled to the acutal config file.

* zsh
** requirements
