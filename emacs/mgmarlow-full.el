;;; init.el --- Emacs configuration -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Save the contents of this file to ~/.config/emacs/init.el and
;; you're ready to boot up Emacs.

;; Hack this file! One of the best ways to get started with Emacs is
;; to look at other peoples' configurations and extract the pieces
;; that work for you. That's where this configuration started. I
;; encourage you to read through the code in this file and explore the
;; functions and variables using the built-in help system (details
;; below). Happy hacking!

;; "C-<chr>  means hold the CONTROL key while typing the character <chr>.
;; Thus, C-f would be: hold the CONTROL key and type f." (Emacs tutorial)

;; - C-h o some-symbol: Describe symbol

;; Set the font. Note: height = px * 100
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Comic Shanns" :height 120)

;; Add unique buffer names in the minibuffer where there are many
;; identical files. This is super useful if you rely on folders for
;; organization and have lots of files with the same name,
;; e.g. foo/index.ts and bar/index.ts.
(require 'uniquify)

;; Automatically insert closing parens
(electric-pair-mode t)

;; Visualize matching parens
(show-paren-mode 1)

;; Prefer spaces to tabs

      ;; I'll add an extra note here since user customizations are important.
      ;; Emacs actually offers a UI-based customization menu, "M-x customize".
      ;; You can use this menu to change variable values across Emacs. By default,
      ;; changing a variable will write to your init.el automatically, mixing
      ;; your hand-written Emacs Lisp with automatically-generated Lisp from the
      ;; customize menu. The following setting instead writes customizations to a
      ;; separate file, custom.el, to keep your init.el clean.

;; Minibuffer completion is essential to your Emacs workflow and

;; `org-mode' is great but Denote makes it even better by adding

;; As you've probably noticed, Lisp has a lot of parentheses.
;; Maintaining the syntactical correctness of these parentheses
;; can be a pain when you're first getting started with Lisp,
;; especially when you're fighting the urge to break up groups
;; of closing parens into separate lines. Luckily we have
;; Paredit, a package that maintains the structure of your
;; parentheses for you. At first, Paredit might feel a little
;; odd; you'll probably need to look at a tutorial (linked
;; below) or read the docs before you can use it effectively.
;; But once you pass that initial barrier you'll write Lisp
;; code like it's second nature.
